As autumn leaves begin to turn, it's once again time for the most anticipated event in the magical community: the Annual Wand Polisher Pub Quiz!

Held at the enchanting Tipsy Troll Tavern, this year promises an evening filled with challenging trivia, laughter, and a showcase of magical camaraderie like no other.

Every year, the Wand Polisher Pub Quiz brings together teams from all corners of the magical realm to test their knowledge on a wide array of subjects, ranging from ancient spells and potion recipes to contemporary magical inventions and the latest in wizarding world news. It's not just about how well you can cast a spell, but also how much you know about the world you're enchanting!

This year, we've added a twist to the classic lineup of questions with special rounds dedicated to magical creatures, historical enchantments, and even a "mystery object" segment where teams will have to identify rare magical artifacts.

Prizes for the top teams include a year's supply of the finest wand polish, gift vouchers to the iWand store, and the coveted Golden Broomstick Trophy for the winning team.

But the Wand Polisher Pub Quiz isn't just for the victors. It's a celebration of our magical community's spirit, knowledge, and traditions.

Participants can enjoy the Tipsy Troll's famous bubbling brews and enchanted appetizers, designed to delight and surprise with every bite.

Whether you’re a seasoned quizzer or just there to cheer on your favorite team, the evening promises fun and excitement for all.

So, gather your teammates, brush up on your magical facts, and don't forget to polish your wand for extra luck!
