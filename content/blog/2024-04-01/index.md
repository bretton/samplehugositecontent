Dear Residents and Visitors,

We find ourselves in the midst of addressing an unexpected and unfortunate incident that has affected our beloved community. Recently, our town had the honor of hosting wizards from various distinguished houses, a gathering meant to celebrate the rich tapestry of magic and camaraderie that binds us all. However, what was intended to be a harmonious convergence of magical talents took an unforeseen turn, leading to an incident that many of you have become acutely aware of—the unusual odor emanating from our sewer system.

The root of this issue traced back to a spirited dispute among visiting wizards from conflicted houses, which resulted in an accidental discharge of magic. This magic, combined with the inherent properties of our sewer system, led to the unintended summoning and subsequent explosion of swamp animals. The aftermath of this magical mishap has left our sewers—and, by extension, our streets—with a lingering scent that is less than pleasant.

We wish to extend our deepest apologies for any inconvenience this has caused to our residents and visitors. The well-being and comfort of our community are our top priorities, and we are fully committed to resolving this issue promptly. Our team of magical sanitation experts is already at work, employing a combination of traditional and arcane methods to cleanse our sewer system of the remnants of this accident. We are also in discussions with the involved parties to ensure that such incidents are avoided in the future, fostering a more respectful and cautious approach to the exhibition of magical abilities in public spaces.

In addition to our clean-up efforts, we will be initiating a series of magical air purification spells across affected areas to alleviate the odor. We anticipate significant improvement within the coming days and will continue to monitor the situation closely, making adjustments as necessary to expedite the restoration of our town's usual aromatic 
ambiance.

We understand the importance of transparency and communication in times like these and will keep you updated on our progress. We also welcome any feedback or suggestions from our community members on how we can better manage such situations in the future or improve our response efforts.

Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to resolve this issue. Thank you for your continued support and for being part of our magical community.

Warmest regards,

Cleric Steve,
Vice-President Walk-in Sales.
