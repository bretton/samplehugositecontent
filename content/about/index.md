iWander has a storied history that spans nearly four centuries, making it one of the oldest and most revered 
purveyors of magical implements in the world. Founded in 1636, it was initially established as a modest workshop 
by Emeric the Enchanter, a renowned wizard known for his groundbreaking work in magical innovation. Through the 
ages, iWander has grown from its humble beginnings into a bastion of magical excellence and innovation.

Over the decades, iWander has served a distinguished clientele that includes some of the most influential figures 
in the magical community. Legends tell of ancient monarchs and wizards, including the likes of Merlin and Morgana, 
who sought Emeric's expertise to enhance their magical arsenals. In the 18th century, iWander was commissioned by 
the secretive Council of Eldritch to create artifacts of immense power, which played pivotal roles in shaping the 
magical landscape.

The store's reputation for quality and craftsmanship has attracted patrons from across the magical and non-magical 
worlds alike. Its customer list reads like a who's who of history's most notable sorcerers, alchemists, and 
adventurers. Among them, Nicholas Flamel was said to have frequented iWander in search of ingredients for his 
alchemical experiments, while in the 19th century, the famed explorer and wizard Phileas Fogg acquired a 
custom-made compass that always pointed to the nearest magical anomaly.

Throughout its history, iWander has adapted to the changing times, embracing new technologies and innovations to 
complement its ancient techniques. The 20th and 21st centuries saw the store undergoing significant 
transformations, introducing digital catalogues and virtual shopping experiences for customers worldwide, while 
still preserving the traditional values and craftsmanship that have defined its legacy.

As it stands today, iWander not only commemorates its rich heritage but also looks to the future, continually 
expanding its collection with the latest in magical advancements. Its continued dedication to excellence and its 
impressive lineage of distinguished customers cement iWander's status as a cornerstone of the magical community, a 
place where history and innovation converge.
