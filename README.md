Pages are directories in `content` with files `index.md` and `background-123.jpg` or `featured-123.jpg` (or .png) 
for content and background or featured image.

## Blog Posts

Blog posts are directories in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` in the diretory `content/blog/..`

## Images

Site background and featured images must go in `assets/img/..`
